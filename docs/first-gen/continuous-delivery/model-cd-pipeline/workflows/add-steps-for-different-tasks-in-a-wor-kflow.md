Different Workflow deployment types involve different Workflow steps. Each type of step, such as **Deploy Containers** or **Verify Service**, has specific commands and options available to it.

### Step: Add Step for Different Workflow Tasks

To add steps, do the following:

2. To use a template, click **Add Step**, and then click **Template Library**. For more information, see [Use Templates](https://docs.harness.io/article/ygi6d8epse-use-templates).
3. If a step has multiple commands, you can arrange them. **Mouseover** the command and then click the **down arrow**.
4. You can also control how the multiple commands and steps are executed. Click the vertical ellipsis next to a step with multiple steps. The execution drop-down appears.
