You can configure a Workflow using YAML. You can view the YAML using the main Code editor, as described in [Configuration as Code](https://docs.harness.io/article/htvzryeqjw-configuration-as-code), or you can jump directly to the YAML of a specific Workflow in the **Workflows** page.

In this topic:

### Before You Begin

* [Workflows](workflow-configuration.md)

### Step: Configure a Workflow as Code

To configure a Workflow as code, do the following:

1. In the **Workflows** page, click the code icon. The code editor appears, displaying your Workflow YAML.![](./static/configure-workflow-using-yaml-12.png)
2. Modify the YAML of the Workflow as needed, and then click **Save**. If you like, you can verify your change in the Harness Manager interface.
