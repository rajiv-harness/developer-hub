Harness is changing how you add steps in Workflows to offer new features for managing commonly-used steps.

The settings inside each step will remain the same, but the user experience will change slightly.

The new UI for Workflow steps will be implemented soon. This document provides an overview of the changes to help with the transition.

Let's take a look at some of the changes.

### Do I Have to Do Anything?

No. Your current Workflows and their step settings will not change. The only change is in the user experience.
